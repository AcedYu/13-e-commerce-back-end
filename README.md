# 13-e-commerce-back-end
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 13 forthe program. In this assignment I was tasked to buidl the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the given starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

It contains notable features such as:
- protection of important login information using .env
- Connection to a mySQL database using Sequelize
- schema and seed commands that create and seed the database with test data
- Working GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes that correspond to being able to view, create, update, and delete data in the mySQL server.
